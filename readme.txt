== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I Show My List of Listings? =

The easiest way to display the archive page for your listing:

1. Create a blank page for each listing type you enable; property, rental, land, business, rural, commercial, commercial-land.

2. Now these pages will display any of the listings you have added.

3. Add the pages to the menu and configure the name eg For Sale but this will use the property slug:

= Is there a sample import file I can use to setup a demo real estate web site? =

Yes! Simply go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer, then navigate to wp-content/plugins/easy-property-listing/assets/ and select the sample-property-import.xml file. This will create several sample properties for yo, make sure "property" is activated.

= Getting a 404 error? =

To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a listing, you need to re-save your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes".

= How do I use the advanced author box on posts and pages? =

Place the php function on your single.php template in your theme <?php do_action( 'epl_single_author' ); ?>

= Can I add integrations for third party real estate applications like 1Form or Inspect Real Estate? =

Yes, through the addition of one or more of the add-on integrations, you can quickly integrate third party buttons to listings. The add-on gateways currently available:
