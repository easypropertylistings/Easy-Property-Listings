== Description ==

Easy Property Listing is one of the most dynamic and feature rich Real Estate plugin for WordPress available on the market today.

An easy to use plugin that provides the needed functions to configure a dynamic real estate website in minutes. Packed with advanced features, shortcodes and templates letting you create real estate websites fast.

> <strong>Theme Setup - Are you feeling lucky?</strong><br>
> The latest release of Easy Property Listings includes a theme compatibility mode that works great for most themes. Once you have activated the plugin visit Dashboard > Easy Property Listings > Settings > Theme Setup. Before you enable the theme compatibility mode, add a listing and preview. If it looks great, you are good to go, however if your listing is too wide or your sidebar is in the wrong place activate Theme Compatibility mode. Next adjust the Theme Setup: Featured Images to adjust how your featured images appear. If you see two featured images play with the settings until it looks great.

> <strong>Manual Theme Setup</strong><br>
> To get the best result from Easy Property Listings on your real estate website you need to either manually [configure your theme](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/docs/setup-wordpress-theme-easy-property-listings-2-0/) using some copy and paste which gives you greater control over your listings. This will enable a better display and will make the plugin look great on any WordPress theme. If you need theme setup assistance first check the [theme support forum](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/support/forum/theme-support/) as we have already created many templates for popular WordPress themes.

> <strong>Premium Support</strong><br>

One on one forum support is available to people who bought [Premium support](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/support/pricing/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=premium_support&utm_campaign=wordpressorg) only.

<strong>Listing</strong><br>
 The [listing] shortcode allows you to output your listings on pages and posts with advanced filtering options for listing types, order, status filtering, locations and much more which you can [read about the settings and options here](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/docs/listing-short-code/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=documentation_link&utm_campaign=wordpressorg).

<strong>Listing Open</strong><br>
The [listing_open] shortcode quickly outputs listings that have scheduled open for inspection times. Use this on posts so your site will always have an up-to-date list of properties open for inspection. Use the [listing_open post_type="property" template="table"] or for rentals and slimmer [listing_open post_type="rental" template="table_open"] option to create a slim list of listings.

The [listing_search] shortcode allows you to place the search widget anywhere you like. Just added to the plugin are new styles to output [listing_search style="wide"] and [listing_search style="slim"] variations. You can also enable the tabbed option with [listing_search post_type="property,rental,land"] and you can adjust the tab labels from the plugin settings page. More [details about the listing_search shortcode can be found here](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/docs/listing_search-short-code/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=documentation_link&utm_campaign=wordpressorg). If you use the search widget you can easily select your options from the widget editor. Enable the tabbed search by multi selecting the listing types with Ctrl on your pc or Command on a mac keyboard.

<strong>Listing Category</strong><br>
Use the [listing_category] short code to filter listings by any variable you want to use. Easy Property Listings has over 30 variables available for each listing type to create specialised pages for anything.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work for bigger companies with multiple agents? =

Absolutely, Easy Property Listings is built from the ground up for scale, speed and thousands of listings. When you want dynamic agent and staff profiles we recommend the [Staff/Agent Directory](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/staff-directory/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=extensions_link&utm_campaign=epl_extension_staff_directory) extension. This allows you to quickly set-up multiple agent and staff members and automatically display all the agents listings, post activity and use a featured image instead of the default Gravatar.

= We want to display less or more info on the archive and single listing views, how can we create a unique customised look? =

You can use the Easy Property Listings template loading system that lets you place all the plugin templates inside themes/YOUR_THEME/easypropertylistings/ folder and edit everything. You can [read more about how to do that here](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/docs/create-custom-theme-templates-using-included-hooks/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq_tab&utm_content=templates&utm_campaign=epl_documentation).

= How do I setup my WordPress theme to work with Easy Property Listings 2.0 =

These instructions are also located inside the plugin. Visit Dashboard > Easy Property Listings > Help > Getting Started > Setup your theme to work with the plugin

= Do I need to know code like php or advanced CSS? =

We built this plugin from the perspective of a real estate agent as that's what I used to do. We want this to be an easy to install and use plugin so you can focus on listing/selling and leasing property. No advanced coding knowledge needed, activate the property types and add listings, so no matter your experience it will work for you.

= How do I Show My List of Listings? =

The easiest way to display the archive page for your listing:

1. Create a blank page for each listing type you enable called; property, rental, land, business, rural, commercial, commercial-land. You can rename them after.

2. Now these pages will display listings of that type as long as you have added one.

= Is there a sample import file I can use to setup a demo real estate web site? =

Yes! Simply go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer, then navigate to wp-content/plugins/easy-property-listing/assets/ and select the sample-property-import.xml file. This will create several sample properties for you, make sure the "property" type is activated.

= Getting a 404 error? =

To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a listing, you need to re-save your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes".

= How do I use the advanced author box on posts and pages? =

Place the php function on your single.php template in your theme <?php do_action( 'epl_single_author' ); ?>

= Can I add integrations for third party real estate applications like 1Form or Inspect Real Estate? =

Yes, through the addition of one or more of the add-on integrations, you can quickly integrate third party buttons to listings. The add-on gateways currently available:

* [1form](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/1form/)
