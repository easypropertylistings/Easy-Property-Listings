Display real estate listings through WordPress with this complete property listing management plugin

== Description ==

Easy Property Listings is a complete real estate solution for property listings in a light, fast, and easy to use plugin. Rather that attempting to provide every feature under the sun, Easy Property Listings makes creating real estate websites simple and complete by providing just the features you need.

* Easy Property Listings has been built developed on the REAXML (Realestate.com.au) format which has hundreds of custom fields with dozens of options. 

We want to expand Easy Property Listings to support real estate formats used around the world. So help us help you build websites for real estate agents in your city, state and country. Supply us with the feed format you use so we can build support into Easy Property Listings making your real estate development much easier... we hope!

Let us know which real estate feed you use and provide a few sample files of the format you need supported. We can then add support to the plugin and import scripts for your real estate feed because you too will configure "Listings" in minutes.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I Show My List of Listings? =

The easiest way to display the archive page for your listing:

1. Create a blank page for each listing type you enable; property, rental, land, business, rural, commercial, commercial-land.

2. Now these pages will display any of the listings you have added.

3. Add the pages to the menu and configure the name eg For Sale but this will use the property slug:

= Is there a sample import file I can use to setup a demo real estate web site? =

Yes! Simply go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer, then navigate to wp-content/plugins/easy-property-listing/assets/ and select the sample-products-import.xml file. This will create several sample products and plugin pages for you.

= Getting a 404 error? =

To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a listing, you need to re-save your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes".

= How do I use the advanced author box on posts and pages? =

Place the php function on your single.php template in your theme <?php do_action( 'epl_single_author' ); ?>

= Can I add integrations for third party real estate applications like 1Form or Inspect Real Estate? =

Yes, through the addition of one or more of the add-on integrations, you can quickly integrate third party buttons to listings. The add-on gateways currently available:

* [1form](http://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/1form/)
