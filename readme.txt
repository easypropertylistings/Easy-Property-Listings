== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work for bigger companies with multiple agents? =

Absolutely, Easy Property Listings is built from the ground up for scale, speed and thousands of listings. When you want dynamic agent and staff profiles we recommend the [Staff/Agent Directory](https://easypropertylistings.com.au/extensions/staff-directory/?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=description_tab&utm_content=extensions_link&utm_campaign=epl_extension_staff_directory) extension.

= We want to display less or more info on the archive and single listing views, how can we create a unique customised look? =

You can use the Easy Property Listings template loading system that lets you place all the plugin templates inside themes/YOUR_THEME/easypropertylistings/ folder and edit everything. You can [read more about how to do that here](http://codex.easypropertylistings.com.au/article/303-how-to-create-custom-widget-templates-using-the-theme-template-loader?utm_source=readme&utm_medium=faq_tab&utm_content=templates&utm_campaign=epl_documentation).

We built this plugin from the perspective of a real estate agent as that's what I used to do.

No advanced coding knowledge needed, activate the property types and add listings, so no matter your experience it will work for you.

= How do I Show My List of Listings? =

The easiest way to display the archive page for your listing:

1. Create a blank page for each listing type you enable called; property, rental, land, business, rural, commercial, commercial-land. You can rename them after.

2. Now these pages will display listings of that type as long as you have added one.

Yes! Simply go to Tools > Import and install the WordPress Importer, then navigate to wp-content/plugins/easy-property-listing/assets/ and select the sample-property-import.xml file. This will create several sample properties for you, make sure the "property" type is activated.

= Getting a 404 error? =

To get rid of the 404 error when viewing a listing, you need to re-save your permalink structure. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click "Save Changes".

= How do I use the advanced author box on posts and pages? =

Place the php function on your single.php template in your theme <?php do_action( 'epl_single_author' ); ?>
